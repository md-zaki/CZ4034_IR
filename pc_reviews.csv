0,"I was planning on jumping straight to Zen4/DDR5 from my ancient Haswell/DDR3 build. Now I'm not so sure.

Would it be better to get a 5800x3d instead, even though the platform is 'dead'?"
1,Reminder to the gamers that 7000 series has an x3d lineup planned for several months out. Would not be jumping on this ship yet unless you run a production environment and need pcie5 right away. 5800x3d exists for those of you itching but feeling decent on am4.
2,"Considering the package price of cpu + mobo + ram, the lower end mass consumer models of 7600x and 7700x are very meh. High end models like 7950x are impressive, but that's going to be a very niche audience.

I'm kind of disappointed tbh."
3,"Okay well that settles it,rip out the 5600x and put in a 5800x3d  and  wait till zen 4+"
4,The 7600X really doesn't make any sense considering it's more expensive than the i7 12700F or even 12700K (including the motherboard cost)
5,"A pretty obvious question: If someone is on 2000/3000 series Ryzen, would you recommend them a 5800X3D (assume they can keep mobo/ram) or the 7000 series?"

7,"Finally, a processor I can grill meat on under normal load temperatures!"
8,"Oof. let's hope i5 Raptor offers better bang for buck.

Either that or I just get the 12700k once 13th gen hits the market. Anyone know if they release tomorrow itself?"
9,"A bit shocked, in a slightly disappointed way. 7600x and 7700x don't look that impressive considering the price to performance. And the IPC uplift from 5950x to 7950x is noticable but meager for it's price you can go grab a 5950x on sale for $540 on Amazon. The productivity gains are the most impressive uplift at least.

Which means more than likely Intel is going to come in hard. AMD should've launched the 3D CPUs alongside the standard models."
10,"Not gonna lie, looking at the benchmarks, I am sitting pretty with my 5800x3D."
