General cost of living is similar to here, but at least S'poreans can eat out cheap if you want to. Also phone and internet are crazy expensive there compared to all other countries, never understood that."
1,"The grass is always greener on the other side. If you have a good job opportunity, sure go ahead but if your just 'thinking' about it, you must understand as a immigrant, there are plenty of 'citizen first' policy like every other developed country. You need a good financial incentive or at least enough to support yourself and then some incase something happens."
2,"I've thought about this before. Starting from nothing is scary though. I'm not a social person. I'm afraid of how others might treat an ""outsider"" to their country. And I'm don't like the idea of being away from current friends and family.

The benefits like cheaper property and car prices seemed less and less important to me the more I thought about it. Its like army, its shit but with the right people it gets better."
3,"I migrated to Korea, coming close to my fifth year in the country. 

Having 4 seasons are a delight but insane typhoons / cold spells / heat waves are also an absolute dread. If you have the chance to live and work overseas, you should take it. It's a valuable life experience even if you eventually decide to return."
4,"For NZ, are you ready for malls to be shut 5pm, limited food options for dinner unless u live downtown, limited “cultural” events such as concerts, art etc ?"
5,"As someone who moved to Germany. I would say secure a job before you move over to the new country. We moved for job reasons and stayed as the life quality is much better. 

Yes taxes are high, but also on the other hand all insurance is paid for. I recall paying at least 100sgd each trip to the GP when my child is sick when we were in Singapore, now everything is covered. I just had a surgery to stop my recurring sinus (which many Singaporean’s have due to air conditioning) and just left the hospital without paying for anything. 

work life balance is great too, my work stops at the 39th hour every week. No need to OT no emails from angry bosses at midnight. 

On the other hand, I miss Singapore food like crazy. Every trip back to Singapore I stock up on like dried scallops, Ikan Billis etc. so I can cook here"
6,"Australia and Canada (esp Vancouver) aren't exactly ideal if you want cheaper property, of course that's if you prefer to live at least 1 hour away from town."
7,"I think the people saying the grass is greener on the other side is very much right. While I doubt you would have trouble living in australia or other, from my personal experience seeing my mother live in australia and currently in Europe. It can be very uncomfortable especially if you aren't a very independent person i.e you cook most nights, you drive and willing to go out of your way to understand people's culture and language. One of the issues that my mum faced was the language and sorta cultural issues especially in australia, where slang caused issues and misunderstanding. However the biggest issue I would say for the average singaporean for moving is the independence aspect where you cannot rely on others for food, transport or just help you understand the other person. It's very unrealistic and caused my mum alot of heartache, in the first 2 years of moving."
8,"I studied then worked in Ireland after NS and as the years went on, my mindset changed from ""I'll definitely return to Singapore after my studies"" to ""I'll only move back if I have absolutely no other choice"". I'm currently living in Australia and absolutely loving it. I have many friends who returned to Singapore after our studies mainly because of family and friends, and often, missing the city lifestyle. Personally, once I've experienced living in cities with a much slower pace of life, I can now never go back to living in a big city.

There are many pros and cons and ultimately it boils down to what's important to you. It is also difficult to move when you're working and not in university - people have established social circles that can be understandably fairly closed off, but it's not impossible and with the internet, finding like-minded individuals is a lot easier."
9,"In respect of your reasons, cost is one that cuts both ways (based on Oz where I lived for a long time).

Yes, cars and houses are much cheaper, but:

- public transport is very expensive;
- eating out min $9 for a food court lunch; 
- taxes are high;
- water and energy are expensive; 
- basically anything involving human labour / services is damned ex so calling a tradesman to fix something in your house will kill you, and having a helper is out of the question unless you are really minting it.

Edited to add: summers are brutal, and most houses do not have fans or air-conditioning. Spring and autumn are lovely though, and I also quite like the mild Aussie winters :)"
10,"I worked in Dubai for 2 years and all I have to say is this: you never know how much you are giving up until you actually lose it.

Together with thinking what you will gain by moving overseas, think of what you will lose in terms of lifestyle."
11,"""The purpose of travel isn't to see foreign lands with your own eyes. The purpose of travel is to see your own land with foreign eyes.""

I personally think everyone should live in a foreign country for at least 2 years just to understand what they have at home. I'm Canadian, and I moved to Brazil for last 5 years and even though it didn't turn out to be my forever home, I feel I grew and learned more in those 5 years than the previous 15.

So yes, if you feel the desire to live elsewhere, and have the opportunity, I'd highly recommend it. You can always come back in a few years. Here's hoping the experience is good for you!"
12,"If you have job opportunities overseas, definitely go, just don’t give up your citizenship until you’re very sure you want to settle elsewhere for life. I left Singapore 10 years ago but now I want to return, however a big part of my life is overseas so it’s not so easy."
13,"Hard truth:

If you have money, anywhere is a paradise and people will treat you nice

Try going to any country and tell people you wash plates for a living and see their disgusted face"
14,"OP, I live in Sydney right now and I just want you to know that a two room apartment in the inner west (lower to mid end location for Sydney) costs around 700k the last time I checked. Rent alone is 3k+ a month. It is true that you generally make more, but the cost of living is way higher and so are the taxes. If cost of living is your gripe, don't consider Australia."
15,"I used to think like that until recent years.

While Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world, there are still economical alternatives to food and etc expenses.

&#x200B;

I can have a boring caipng meal for 2.50 while if I makan at ""well-fare"" states, it's around 12 bucks. Maybe because I'm frugal and don't often pamper myself.

&#x200B;

I do have expensive hobbies like modding and retro consoles collection, big boy toys. It's cheaper to buy it here but if ain't available, just have to pay market (worldwide) price"
16,"...and here I am planning to buy property in Singapore to relocate permanently because I am sick of the depressing weather in Vancouver, the fucking racism, lack of culture, crackheads,  shit quality of life, expensive (googling shows 10~20% higher expenses than singapore) living costs.

the grass is literally greener here and other than big outdoor nature there is not much going for vancouver. so many people are abandoning vancouver. r/vancouver is a very good reflection of what the city is beneath its surface.

i've always felt that Singapore is Vancouver that made it in life. I've known two singaporeans that came to Vancouver and noped the fuck out after less than 5 years."
17,"Pre-2008, I had always thought of migrating as well, I actually tried applying for the American Green Card lottery once  


I had shitty job, shitty prospect and poor qualification  


What changed? in 2007, I completed my part time degree. In the same year I got a job which is a regional role so I started traveling, A LOT. I have since traveled to(for both work and leisure) over 60 across all 6 continents. We're probably having it better than 99.99% of everywhere I've been to. Living and working in a place and traveling for leisure or reading it from media are totally different things. I realized first hand how we've been brainwashed and pretty much fooled into thinking many other nations have it better. If you really think SG is expensive, I got news for you. The so called most expensive country in the world is pretty much fake news if you take into account median local wages and standard of living in most countries. We're really only expensive for expats not locals. It makes me appreciate SG way more.   


Of coz life in SG isn't for everyone, as a small country there is a lot of limitations to the things that it can offer. COVID-19 is a fine example while people living in China for example have been able to resume domestic travel and vacation, we're still stuck in our 1 city. Space is something that SG simply cannot offer.  


As for me right now, there isn't anywhere else I want to be in the mid term. Will probably change when I am closer to retirement. Base on current trajectory, I should be able to retire comfortably in SG but I am looking out for places that might be better to retire vs SG. Weather being my biggest bugbear"
18,"Yup, been there done that with Germany. My ""dream"" was to move to a better country and get their citizenship. Turned out Germany is more 3rd world than Malaysia (Malaysia born so I can say that =) Germany in the 2010's/2020's is very much like Malaysia in the 90's like:

* Literally all public toilets must pay money while still being dirty, nicer experience to just find a quiet side street and piss for free.
* Heavily cash-only society - Credit card possible mostly with larger shops and restaurants. Maybe covid has changed this for the better. A couple of years ago, they were still boasting about contactless payments like it was the most innovative shit in the world when Asia, Australia, etc had been using it for YEARS already.
* Really underestimated the amount of racism stacked against Asians over there. **If you are single, Asian and male, and plan to eventually start a family, NEVER move to Europe and waste your youth**. You'll go there single and most likely stay single until you leave.

If you know any other Malaysians, you've probably also heard the classic tagline Malaysians say about Malaysia ""1st world infrastructure, 3rd world attitude/mentality"" can absolutely be applied to Germany.

More [truths about living in Germany here](https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/5002087)

The only upside is salary if you're in your 20's to 30's, my first job I got there with just a couple years experience paid 50k EUR/year. Matching my lifestyle and savings rate in Singapore would have required 7k SGD a month, which would have been impossible for me at that point in my career in Singapore.

Now that I can demand 10k SGD gross monthly, Singapore is a much better option. To match that in Germany would require making 90k EUR gross annually. It's near impossible to breach the 6 figure EUR salary mark in Germany unless you're in a really specialized field or superstar on your industry."
19,"As a M’sian who grew up in Singapore and lived in US for the past 2 decades, I’ll say, the grass is always greener on the other side. 

Good properties, meaning the ones that are close to the city where most jobs, amenities, and events are, or better moderate climate, amazing views,  will always be expensive. It’s universal regardless of countries 

Canada is nice, Toronto and Vancouver are probably the two cities most Asians would like to migrate to. Properties on both cities are exorbitantly expensive. 

Affordable ones are usually further into the suburbs. Living in the suburbs and working in the city is akin to living in JB and working in Singapore. The commute is a killer. 

Cost of living is only lower if you’re a small town and with little job prospects. If you want to be in a bigger city with better job prospects, the cost of living is similar to Singapore. 

Another factor to think about is winter. Winters are amazingly beautiful the first day, I still don’t tired of it after 20+ years.

Winter on day 2 until the season ends, which is usually 4-5 months later, is unbearably dreary. I’ve been in 2 snowpocalapse and 4 -40 Fahrenheit  winters.  It wears you down mentally and emotionally.  However some do love it, so this is subjective. 

What about food, lifestyle, and culture? At the end of the day, there are pros and cons in every country. What I found in North America that Singapore couldn’t match is the vast amount of nature available for hiking, rock climbing, overlanding, off-road riding, driving, auto sports, etc. In Singapore you’ll have to travel to other countries to do the above. 

Bottom line, good climate will always be expensive. Quality of life and cost of living is what you make it to be. 

Hope this helps."
20,"In as much as I thought it'd be nice to get out of Singapore for good, I'd never really thought migration would ever be possible.

But when the Australian opportunity came, I jumped at it. It's been 12 years on and I've never looked back once with any regret. 

Life is so much more comfortable, meaningful and carefree now."
21,"FYI you can do a working holiday to Australia and New Zealand as long as you meet certain conditions, like being under 30 years old.

Also if you do want to move, I would say to make sure you have a decent job over there, or you'll be too busy/poor/stressed to enjoy the country.

I work in Tokyo as a software engineer. The majority of the foreigners here seem to be in tech, English teaching, or hospitality. A word I've heard people used to describe Japan is ""comfortable"", when asked why they stay. Generally, people aren't going to bother you and you can do your own thing. And Tokyo is also surprisingly affordable for a city like itself, if you know where to look to save money. But it's not what most people would describe as relaxing, which seems to be what you're looking for. People who want a relaxed pace of life would probably move somewhere like Fukuoka or the countryside."
22,"no, I plan to migrate too. I feel the need to run around like in the sound of music and go roll down a grassy hill that isn't bukit timah."
23,No you are not
24,"As someone who has lived and has plans to continue living in Australia in the future, I gotta say the climate isn’t exactly the best HAHA. It’s fine throughout most of the year (albeit a little dry) but when summer comes, brace yourself for 40 degree celcius temperatures lol."
25,"I think about it too. And I evaluate the options rationally.

Malaysia and Indonesia? Cheaper cost of living, but generally poorer quality of life and safety and security.

Canada? Vancouver actually has pricier real estate than Singapore. Toronto is slightly better, but does not enjoy the benefits of wonderful natural attractions as the west coast (interesting to note that the west coast of continental America is as beautiful as it is because of underlying geological fault lines - the very same reason for which they are expecting the “Long overdue” major earthquake). Toronto lifestyle is also more closely aligned with the East Coast of America - hard charging, work 9-9. Chill Canada is on the west coast and other parts. Live in the center of the country where you do not get to enjoy the material comforts you’ve grown up to be used to? Benefit is great welfare system. 

Australia? Again, Sydney and Melbourne real estate prices are comparable. Pace of life is definitely slower and more enjoyable. Whether the country/culture is welcome of immigrants recently is another matter of concern. 

Long story short - you can keep thinking, but make sure you’re not just dreaming. Do your research and rationally weigh your options.

For me, I’ve gotten resigned that I won’t be wealthy enough to live comfortable life’s in most of the places you listed. I will be content with owning a small piece of land in a rural part of a less developed but safe and welcome country like Taiwan or Thailand. (Taipei and Bangkok are out of reach for me too without maintaining the current levels of work activity, and I would say most of us)"
26,"Singapore is not perfect but it is better than many places. Instead of migrating, I would rather stay here and try to fix what I can fix and adapt to things that I can’t fix."
27,"I used to think like u when I am young but after traveling to many countries for leisure and work(1-3mths). I still think Sg is the best.
So i came up with a plan for my retirement, during May-Aug period, I am planning to stay at Aus or NZ (depending on e Hazes situation in Sg)and Nov-Feb in around Japan/Korea /Cn/Tw. The rest of the period will be in SG.I think the Airbnb is not that exp and u can move around seeing different cities in details. My point is don’t be fixated in your mindset. Go out and see the world for yourself before you decide.
For now there might be changes due to covid so I don’t know how will things turn out in the future."
28,"Australia is very tough to move to nowadays from what I've heard and read. They've got plenty of immigrants already, like us. Nz might be a better option, but it's more laid back. Not every one would like that type of lifestyle."
29,"Lived in New York for a year. Realised the true meaning of “you don’t know how good you’ve got it until you lose it”. 

Suggest you take a short stint in your place of choice, with a minimum of 1 year, before doing the full move. Sometimes it may just be you looking at things through rose tinted glasses."
30,"You are most definitely not alone. Especially amongst the younger generation.

Whether it is feasible with current world events is another thing entirely."
31,[deleted]
32,"Singapore will always have a special place in my heart because this is where I grew up, but no you're not alone."
33,Have you lived through at least one winter before?
34,"Hey, giving some perspective here. 

I'm living in France, I pay a huge chunk of my salary to social security but I love my life here and it's good to know that I can depend on the public health if I get any health issues. The quality of life here is great - I eat organic, go to the farmers market and buy produce/food from artisans directly, spend my evenings strolling around the city/parks, grab drinks with friends on weekends and occasionally take long weekends to spend time at family home in the countryside.

Expenses here are high but it's enough since I don't really buy too much clothes, bags, etc. I also realised that I'm starting to focus less on money and more on what makes me happy."
35,"Trust me I have faced an even greater push factor to leave Singapore. Climate and expensive properties are actually far down in the list of reasons why I want to leave. 

I have never really felt connected to Singapore. Being gay, I think I have a much greater chance of establishing a family if I were to migrate. I hate the corporate culture in Singapore. I have always wanted to leave all the unhappy memories behind from school, NS and work. Personally, I have always looked towards New Zealand, because I have cousins there. 

But you must understand that the grass appears greener on the other side. By virtue of being ethnically Asian, you will get discriminated against - whether covertly or blatant. These countries also have a stronger “citizens-first” policy. 

When it comes to jobs, they have work-life balance and minimum wage. But in Western countries, their corporate culture is that they can get very personal with criticisms, and yet they expect you not to take it personally. 

Property prices may cheaper than SG but then you have to factor in that expenditure may increase in other aspects like taxes and stuff. 

Migrating is also a financial risk. You will see your savings chipped away while you transition to your new life overseas. I dont know but personally I feel that I am not ready to take that risk."
36,"I did some calculations awhile back, even with 7k monthly salary i will still have problem retiring unless i forgo having children.

Looking forward to retire in taiwan in maybe 10 years time with my wife when i amass enough saving and sell my hdb."
37,"not me, i love my food too much"
38,"Apart from properties and housing, almost everything is cheaper (living expenses wise) in Singapore.

This and convenience is one thing that you will miss terribly, unless you earn a lot of money or is already rich."
39,"Lived in 3 cities previously.

I would say I appreciate things like the weather, greenery, more open spaces, and less hectic pace. I still find Singapore cheaper in terms of food and transport. Services for medical care, government documentation, taxes, knowing what are your rights / legal documents, and ease of knowing people are still better in Singapore.

Overall, I guess if you are looking to retire, I might consider migration, but to earn an income, possibly Singapore is still a good place to consider."
40,10 years in Melbourne with my family and absolutely love it. I'm 51 so have seen and experienced quite a bit. Happy to answer questions if you have any.
41,"No extreme weather (tho climate change is shaking things up), no natural disasters, knowing I’m a first class citizen with privileges, and efficiency and food within a stone’s throw. So, even though I do wonder sometimes, I always conclude that SG will always be Home."
42,I do too. Every single day
43,"I moved to Japan 4 years ago. To be fair, QOL and weather would depend on your own personal likes and dislikes. I generally enjoy life in Tokyo more than in Singapore because of the range of activities available, and the weather is definitely more to my liking than Singapore. Cost of living, I would say would be roughly the same, or possibly more because of taxes. Taxes and social contribution is downright low in Singapore.

Potential downsides include separation from family and friends, uprooting and restarting your entire social circle, cultural shock, and adjustment difficulties. These impact you mainly on the mental health side, so unless you are able to create or join new social circles very fast, I would advise a little caution with this. Also something to note would be that your career trajectory and income might not be comparable to Singapore. I would say for a lot of jobs, Singapore's remuneration is relatively high.

However, I'd only advise making the move if you are single. If you're married or attached, even if your spouse or partner says that they're on board, they might not take to the above downsides as well as you and that would lead to a **lot** of relationship problems."
44,"Singapore is not for retirement, the Singapore dream is to earn enough to retire somewhere else.

Of course if you are planning to work overseas, the expenses might not be lower if you have to work in the city."
45,"I'm fairly sure there are some people in this subreddit that have already migrated overseas, anyone care to share their experience?"
46,"yes, i’m one of the hordes of singaporeans hoping to move to australia. i earn <3k here as a nurse, and can get twice that in aus. i’ll still manage to save even after factoring in housing and taxes. going to apply under pr visa so i’ll have less taxes + other benefits too. 

singapore is nice enough, but the biggest push factor for me is that i want to start a family. i did high school in australia and for someone with ADD, it’s night and day. i wasn’t even diagnosed when i went there, but the teaching style is really different, and i managed to get the first As i’ve had since primary school. my ozzie classmates even complained that they were stressed about studying 2-3 hours per day during exam season. totally different from my O levels experience. i really truly don’t want to have kids if theyve got to grow up in the sg system."
47,"I studied a year in Paris and as cliche as it sounds, living outside Singapore made me realise that I took many things for granted in Singapore. Personally, if I were given a choice to live in Paris or Singapore, I would choose Singapore. Although, I had visited the south of France and I liked the chill lifestyle there, living there might interest me.  
  
Life in Singapore isn't perfect, but it sure is better than most other countries in several ways. If I were to start a family, Singapore remains one of the top countries in my mind. The biggest benefits of living in Singapore compared to other countries, in my opinion, is the level of safety, extremely good infrastructure and the food. Plus, the education standard here is extremely good if I were to have kids here.  
  
Like what another comment says, look at how you can improve your life here first. If there are serious dealbreakers (like LGBT issues), then consider migrating. But keep in mind that you also give up many benefits of living in Singapore."
48,"I'm Australian (from Canberra), moved here just before the pandemic hit. There are pros and cons to both places. Not too sure about the other cities in Australia, but property prices in Canberra are cheaper than here, and the thing that really irks me about Singapore is basic groceries here seem to be almost double what I'd pay back home. And, being from Canberra, I totally agree with you on the weather. After a few months here, I've started to really miss the super cold and windy days Canberra gets in the winter.

That said, however, Singapore is great because the cost of living can be either really high or really low depending on how you adjust your lifestyle. Since we started working from home, my average monthly budget here is \~$300 - $350, not including rent. If I was still in Canberra, I'd be spending quite a bit more than that. My only expense here is food, and eating out at a small, non-touristy hawker centre can often be cheaper than buying groceries and cooking yourself. I also only occasionally take public transport these days, because Singapore is small enough that you can walk to pretty much any major amenity you need. I'm also only paying something like 1 or 2% income tax which is always great.

In Canberra, however, you can't really survive without a car, though the government is trying to (*very* slowly, to conveniently make election issues) fix that. Australian public transport in general is so much worse, and so much more expensive than it is here - Perth is the only place I've lived with decent public transport infrastructure, but that's helped quite a bit by the city's geography. If there's anyone from Perth here, they can correct me, but I believe with my student discount, I was paying $5 for a train trip into the CBD over there, as opposed to the $2 I pay here. Australia also has super expensive mobile and internet services, and those are generally lower quality than what we get here because there isn't any real competition - Telstra has the best coverage of the country, and they pretty much have a monopoly in the regional and rural areas, so most people would be with them unless they *never* leave whatever capital city they live in. Competition between internet providers is better, but it's still not great - there are a few smaller ISPs popping up that offer better services at more reasonable prices than the big ones (Telstra, Optus, etc), but not too many. Back home, my monthly budget was \~$400 - $500 not including rent, and depending on how much driving I had to do.

So yeah, Australia isn't really as cheap as you might think, and if you budget right, you'll probably end up with a much lower cost of living in Singapore. However, I'd definitely be lying if I said I wanted to settle down here. Since moving here, I've come to the view that Singapore is an amazing place to visit and maybe spend a few weeks, but it's not as good a place to live as Australia, despite being cheaper."
49,"Migrated years ago and actually thinking of moving back.  None of the factors you mentioned really matter.  Climate, living quality, expenses, Singapore's has its pros and cons.  What I really appreciate living overseas is the people.  Most Singaporean's mindset are so toxic - way too competitive, critical and negative."
50,"I have a property in another country but it doesn't allow retirement visa but I'm definitely moving when I retire. Don't see the point of being old and dying here. If you can go, go."
51,"I don't even have the full rights/protections afforded to everyone here, so yes, all the time."
52,"Depending on which part of Canada or Australia you go, it may not be cheaper than Singapore"
53,"Migrate to Austin, Texas. Booming tech scene in the south for jobs. Affordable housing compared to Singapore. You can get a cheap car for under 10k for transportation. Downside is healthcare obviously and higher taxes, but the wages are higher."
54,"It's good to move away for awhile to see how good you've got it in SG. Been there, done that. Moved to South Orange County (arguably the nicest place in the US to live in) and loved the weather, the people, the space, but also missed my family, the convenience, and the food. It was super safe but can't say the same about other parts of the US. 

Want cheaper rent/housing? Compromise on convenience, housing, weather. Want good weather, beautiful spaces, and convenience? Prepare to pay high rents or mortgages. 

In the end there is no win-win. Every country has its pros and cons. However I definitely recommend living in another country for awhile to broaden your perspectives and gain a new appreciation for Singapore. 

Like someone else has mentioned, there is a 'citizens first' policy in every country, so if you're a Singapore citizen, you have an advantage. Similarly, if you're an immigrant somewhere else, expect to be treated as such."
55,"Op, i am under the impression you're quite young. I am sgean but lived in Australia for eight years now. If you're young enough, try taking on some working holidays - it gives you an insight on what's life like here in Australia, gets you a job for some experience which would be valuable on your résumé wherever you go, and you're not permanently tied to a country yet. I think some other countries do have that scheme in place. Of course, after restrictions are lifted. 

The grass always looks greener on the other side. I never realised how much of a kopitiam girl I was till I come here. I miss tze char so much, hahahaha."
56,"Having lived a couple places myself, it's fair to say that (in contrary to widespread beliefs) Singapore's cost of living is not bad at all. For the quality of housing, infrastructure, etc it's quite a good deal. Especially if you exploit all ""citizen benefits"" like BTOs, subsidies and CPF. Don't get me wrong, Singapore's not cheap, but capital/metropolitan cities of basically all Western countries are more expensive coming in as a foreigner. Not even mentioning the high tax rates (I had 21% GST on top of 53% income tax at some point...), don't go there for reducing your cost of living!

Having said that, in my opinion, a lot of ""Western"" (to lump them all together, which doesn't do it justice at all) cities provide much better quality of life in terms of work/life, cultural exposure, entertainment options, liveliness of the city, (variability of) weather, etc.

Furthermore, in exchange for the high taxes (esp in Europe), you get access to world class healthcare for (almost) 0$, awesome social safety nets (I got government support for being in between jobs for 2 weeks, at nearly S$1000 a week (beat that, SG!)) and awesome (international) infrastructure (Amsterdam - Berlin by car <5 hrs, Paris - London by high speed train, etc etc), which makes it seem so much less like you're ""locked in"" to the place you happen to live (like Singapore does sometimes)."
57,"Just make sure you know what you want regarding quality of life. 

In Singapore despite the high cost of living,the quality of life is higher in some respects due to low crime, lack of poverty and orderly society. 

I moved to America and had no illusions about retaining those, but that's not what I was after. In New York City, there's a greater emphasis on the arts, work-life balance (even though it's one of the worst in Western countries), and excitement and career advancement (this is industry dependent) but I'm trading all of that for safety and am living in a fractured and unequal society. 

Have no illusions, the grass is not greener on the other side. There are almost always tradeoffs, just be fully aware of what they are."
58,"I always wanted to migrate. Until I actually started studying and living overseas, that I no longer want to migrate."
59,"I wanted to migrate till I did have an opportunity to live overseas for a while. Now I'm planning to return.

The quality of life in Singapore is comparable to if not better than most western countries. Expenses in are a mixed bag, food's cheap, housing and healthcare depends on where you're going, cars are more expensive. Housing is more expensive than Singapore in most major cities actually. See: http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf

I thought I hated the climate, but after trudging through the snow on your 3rd January you'll probably start appreciating the tropical climate. I did.

Finally, I don't think any of those factors offset things like a good educational system, low crime, low(ish) poverty, good and affordable public transportation, etc. Not for me anyway. Immigrating is a personal decision, of course, but make sure you have more than just surface-level reasons. The grass isn't really greener on the other side."
60,"I spent 12 years in Australia, currently back in Singapore for a bit of work and waiting for Covid to clear up before heading to Europe to find work. 

Things I like in Singapore
1) Generally safe at night. Some places in Melbourne I wouldnt be caught dead after 9 pm, some place you just dont go since its infested with druggies on a high

2) Good transportation. Australia is massive so unless you live close to CBD where the transport is good, further out in suburbs the buses and trains do take some time to come

3) Racism? Aussies arent generally racist but most Singapore Chinese, being used to the majority privilege find it a bit of a shock when they become a minority and every little slight becomes 'racism'. It usually is not but of course, nasty racists are always around

4) Cheap and good food 24/7. After dark, its only kebabs or MacDonalds in Australia. Food in Australia is expensive and the portions are big although its debatable. Australians generally prepare their own meal, eating out is uncommon

I'll probably head back to Australia for retirement or maybe Thailand. I really like the wide open space, going for a drive, exploring the country, going to strawberry farms or vineyard. I enjoy surfing on the Gold Coast. Fresh air always in Australia and I like the four seasons with mild winter. Good work life balance too in Australia"
61,"I’m not quite sure why so many of the comments are talking about retirement? 

I’m assuming OP is still young and probably at the best age to emigrate and try living elsewhere. Obviously it’s made a bit tougher with COVID, but I would recommend it if you fantasise about it. We only get one shot at life."
62,"No, birds do too."
63,"I'm from India, lived in the US (Bay Area) for 8 years, I honestly prefer it here. It's a great mix of warm Asian culture and 1st world infra. If you're under 30 and single, I'd recommend the US, it's a great place to be young and free in, compared to SG. SG otoh is a great place to be mid-career.

If I could have Bangalore's weather and the Bay Area's entrepreneurial energy, that would be paradise, but nowhere is perfect. That said, I am eyeing Penang for retirement mainly because of SG real estate."
64,"How is the property expensive? I bought my 2 Room HDB near Bouna Vista didn't even fork a single cent for downpayment after using government cpf grant. Then all monthly installment paid by CPF. Only thing I need to pay is my renovation and electrical appliances etc.

Don't tell me your goal is to stay landed house then you go Malaysia lor. And remember build ur fence very high because of the security there. Life is more important than money and big houses."
65,friend and his wife moved to one of those countries and hangs out with asians only. no wonder no one wants migrants in their country :X
66,"Lol all those places are very expensive too. I wanna save up $ and migrate too.. to a pleasant cheaper, smaller city in Msia like Ipoh or Kuching."
67,"As with everything else (relationship, job, cca, etc), if you don't try you will never find out. But also as with everything else, the grass could be greener on the other side, but it's maybe difficult for most to see what they lose that they have taken for granted. 

In relationships, for example, I'm sure you know of instances of people regretting breaking up, and conversely, people who found the one after breaking up and ended up marrying well. 

I guess another consideration is how much you think the other party cares. Enough to compromise/change reasonably? Enough to make you stay?

I suppose you probably already have your own answers to the above hence you thought about emigration in the first place. Just go for it I guess, you never know."
68,I'm okay with the humidity. SG is good cos travels to Asian countries is convenient as I prefer to explore Asia and we don't have any natural disasters yet. But I have to agree with you on the property prices being expensive compared to last time.
69,"If you can get a chance, give it a try.

I did it twice. Once when I was given the opportunity to work in Singapore, and again when we migrated to Australia.

It's crazy different, ups and downs, but in the end I think it was worth it."
70,"""Generally lower expenses"" everything is relative, not to mention you'll pay higher taxes in those countries."
71,"To be fair, if you have the money. It's all the same anywhere in the world."
72,I always see this from Singaporeans especially younger ones. Migrating is harder than you think
73,"Just curious, have you ever stayed overseas and tried to live ""like a local"" for at least a year?"
74,"Man. I want to migrate. I feel so trapped in sg. But with a private degree, scant work experiences and mental illness,I know I can only join the working holiday programme. My goose was truly cooked after I entered poly accountancy."
75,"Studied and working in US for 6 years. 
Seems like for many in the thread, small things in life like cheap cooked food, are part of the consideration.

I wouldn’t have the opportunity to do this work in SG, because there’s simply no such work. And my expertise is appreciated! Also, much less ageism and discrimination - tbh, i’ve experienced more discrimination in SG.

Canada has been experiencing a boom in immigrant jobs since the US stopped issuing work visas.

As for the SG preoccupation with property and car ownership ... there’s a huge diversity and options: you can get a $500 clunker, a classic BMW, a family SUV or 15 year old Toyota Corolla!

As for rental and property, you can find all sorts of places, depending on your budget and needs. Could even get a fixer-upper... The options are so limited in SG if you’re not rich. Get married for BTO, or live with parents, or share a place with others. There aren’t any affordable 1 bedroom apartments..."
76,"Always on my mind, sg is too boring and hot but I won’t consider ang mo countries for long term stay"
77,"You’ll get bored in nz less you got a lot of friends there and are ok with the culture. I’ve stayed in nz before and dated a girl from there. Fun for holidays but not long term imo. Houses aren’t the best, just everything is far apart, it’s too quiet, very western mentalities and culture (like shops and stuff close early, not too much night life). I’d say ur better off in Singapore or canada."
78,"I am thinking about it too. But not for climate and stuff. Thought of migrating to somewhere else. I am tired of  expensive cost. I am tired of regulations and the big white guys telling me how to live. I am currently still researching the difference staying in Mumbai and parts of Australia. travelled to Mumbai once, love the vibe there. In the end extend my trip from one week to 2 weeks. Food is cheap there as well and love the people there but then again there are worries as well in Mumbai such as hygiene, medical and stuff. 

Australia wise, though high taxes, health care is free. Their pension system is better than our CPF. Had a chat with an Indian family who hosted airbnb once at suburbs of Melbourne. A lot of my friends were warning me about racism which I didn't get a chance to face there and I thought I fit in okay (had multiple stories that I have to explain that I was a tourist when I was approached by various Australians about bus routes to the city).

I never had a chance with the bureaucratic systems in both countries but I have dealt with the people in Singapore. I have been scoffed off and scolded multiple times. I have been treated with condescending and passive aggressiveness.  (""If you can't handle the financial problem, just close shop la."" This was the first time that my family asked for an extension in the decade and it was in a recession. ) ( I have another story that JTC (Singapore government owned industrial management) gave a less than $5 discount with the new lease during the covid 19 pandemic). Yeah as efficiently as they boast, I really don't need shit like that from anyone especially I paid my taxes as well. 

As for Singapore being cheap, unless you tell me you are going to the same store order the same packet of rice and pray inflation never goes up, having a night out, getting a drink in Singapore is not even cheap even from supermarket."
79,"I think many people do ba. The cost of housing is crazy - my friend gave up his 4 room HDB and bought a 3 storey house, a car and had cash to spare when he moved to Australia (he didn't move downtown because the point for him was to move away from ""the big city""). I have friends in NZ too and the cost can't even be compared. 


The only real upside of living in SG really is the availability of cheap and good food IMO. Definitely work here, but I would say keep your options open to the possibility of semi-retiring/retiring elsewhere. This is especially so if your job/skills are something that is portable and does not require you to physically come into the office.  


I have my eye on a city or two overseas, but as my job requires me to be physically in SG, for now suck thumb lor."
80,"here's a different take: ""sg is a great docking station and i'm constantly thinking of travelling."""
81,"You are not alone. Singapore isn't an ideal country to spend your retirement in or even work for that matter and I was considering moving elsewhere on the globe. Except, this is no easy feat and lots of research have to be done."
82,"All of these places do not have lower expenses unless you intend to live away from the city.

Australia is a place with one of the hottest summers but it is always nice to have seasons of some sort."
83,"There's nothing wrong with wanting to move to somewhere else. Some ppl prefer a colder climate, some ppl prefer safety, some ppl value ""muh freedom"" over anything else. And regarding the grass is always greener on the other side, this is tricky. After a decade or so, no matter how great a place is, you are bound to get sick of it. But countries aren't something most ppl have the luxury of changing every now and then, unlike what you have for lunch where you feel like having chicken rice today and pizza tomorrow. But if you can afford it and you want a change of environment, why not?"
84,youre not the only one
85,"Not migrating (permanently) necessarily, but definitely want to try living and working overseas for a few years at least. For me, I want to experience living in proximity to nature spots that I could go hiking/skiing on the weekend. Thinking about UK/Europe. 

For long term, it definitely depends on your own priorities and preferences but I think Singapore is one of the best choices tbh, humidity notwithstanding haha."
86,"If you're looking to escape stupidly expensive property, I wouldn't recommend Australia.  All the big cities have Singapore-level prices, with the median price over $1 million in Sydney -- good luck saving up that much when you're also paying 50% income tax.  Unlike Singapore, there's no public housing for sale, and renting it is only for the desperate and destitute.

That said, Sydney weather is really nice though, and while $1m gets you a cramped old condo in Sg, it's enough for a reasonably nice property under an hour's drive from the CBD."
87,yes
88,"Thought of it a lot when I was younger, then you realise how difficult it is to get anywhere these days. It's easily a 8-10 year process for the good countries with a tonne of caveats unless you studied or worked there. Either that or you have plenty of money.

There are also many good reasons why a lot of people migrate to Singapore, and when I started seeing things in that light and evaluate all the push and pull factors - I thought of migrating less. Truth be told, this is easily one of the best countries to live in whether people believe it or not. I still dislike many aspects of Singapore but it gets better when you choose to pay less attention to them."
89,"I have the same thoughts too, but at the same time I'm worried about my mum who's currently single and moved to SG from China many years ago. If I want to move overseas, I'll have to leave her alone behind, and obviously I can't do that since I'm her only kin in SG. But there's not much place I can move to with her since she took a long time to settle in SG and still can't speak very fluent English even til today. And my mother had it very hard when she moved here so she don't want me to go through the same as her, but I still want to experience how is it to live in a foreign land afterall. I always feel that the world is too big and beautiful and there's so much to explore and learn but you won't be able to if you're forever stucked on this tiny island.

I still love Singapore though and am honestly proud to be a Singaporean, but I would really like to experience and see different things in life."
90,"SG's property is crazy expensive but still, you manage to buy it as long as you work, look at HK and TW, even the Millennials are still very far from purchasing a property in the city. HK is worse, I don't think a normal white/blue collar is able to finish their housing loan alive. 

Humidity isn't a concern for me as I came from a neighbor country. As a foreigner here, what I can't stand living here is the boring lifestyle. Might be due to I have not much friends here. Quoting /u/TinOfRocks : Its like army, its shit but with the right people it gets better."
91,What do the sg expats overseas think of the country they've migrated to?
92,I'm always checking my alembic scripts.
93,When I entered Singapore my goal was to find a girlfriend and try to get a PR here. But both seems to a difficult choice so I opted to immigrate to Canada
94,"You could consider Denmark or Norway though, I don't know much about them but I heard they have excellent health care and better retirement payouts"
95,"Honestly I would love to actually be given a choice to consider remaining here in Singapore. But unfortunately if I want to have a semblance of a 'normal life' I would have to move. Giving myself a few years until I turn 30 before I start planning for a move to Ireland to be with my partner. The things I will probably miss the most in SG is my family and friends, food, security and public transport efficiency. The biggest positive for life there is probably the climate, the people and the slower pace of life."
96,"I moved away in 2019. Hopefully I can get a PR in the future. This is a big decision and don't take it lightly. And most of all, listen to yourself. The choice to migrate is a very personal decision"
97,"I left after 13 years. Came back to the US. 

I miss singapore a lot."
98,Oh im sorry to hear I hope youre better now :) honestly Singaporean poly diplomas are super useful. If you apply for private u have sooo many exemptions. Oo okay good to know about the private deg + work exp = masters. Im still contemplating my next move!! Also wow @ them... What a dream
99,"I use a wheelchair because I have mild muscular dystrophy, and while the healthcare here has really improved my quality of life a hell of a lot (and I'm eternally grateful for that), the attitudes and lack of rights for people with disabilities, as well as the strenuous work culture means I'll have to go elsewhere for my postgrad. For that reason I'm thinking of emigrating to England or Australia, where disability rights and access are more prioritised, and the work culture is a bit more relaxed. Whether I get a job offer abroad after that, however, is a different story..."
100,Love Singapore but sometimes I do dream of living in a Japanese countryside town
101,"Haha I do too but not for the reasons you listed. Honestly Singapore is a really good place, and the property isn’t really that expensive compared to the places you listed.


The climate here is literally what most people in the world wants. Our climate is consistent, and has zero natural disasters.


While I admit our quality of life isn’t the best, I personally don’t think it’s worth wanting to move over, but this is more personal and objective so I can’t really argue about this"
102,only cause the weather is really bad for my skin condition.
103,Australia is the most expensive place in the world for food dude
104,"I don't mean this with any malice, but please do. Then you'll know how good we have it here. It's not perfect and ultimately it boils down to what you want out of life so maybe SG living really isn't your cup of tea. But you'll never know until you try it for yourself. (Covid permitting disclaimer)"
105,"If you have that opportunity given, go to that side. 

Opportunity is always 1st."
106,"I have always thought of moving to the countries you mentioned but I could never imagine what it would be like,the harsh reality that awaits me if I do move. Maybe one day,if I have the money to do so."
107,"It's my long-term goal to migrate, but for different reasons.

Our main vulnerabilities are:

* Low taxes are supposed to attract and retain FDI

* Food security because we need to import almost everything

Our long-term threat (excluding armed conflict and economic irrelevance through risk aversion):

1. Rising sea levels in the next 50 years, which will

2. Require us to spend significant amounts of money on flood prevention. The estimations range from [a couple million a year](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4768127_The_impact_of_sea_level_rise_on_Singapore) to [1 billion a year.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-economy-prime-minister/protecting-singapore-from-rising-sea-levels-could-cost-s100-billion-idUSKCN1V80GU) 

3. Severely impact our food security

Points #2 and #3 will cause taxation to increase, *and* cause businesses to move out. The issue of food security in our region can also cause possibility of armed conflict to spike.

I'd love to fuck off to Canada or somewhere in the far northern hemisphere (aka Scandinavia) which will warm up and exploit that for their agricultural gain."
108,i do. but money no enough. i need to secure money and honey before starting the process
109,"Wanting to migrate to another country without living there as a citizen for a prolonged period is the same as marrying that pretty girl or handsome hunk before dating them

You think you do, but you don't"
110,Grass always greener on the other side. Go ahead. Bye.
111,"Nope, where else can i watch sinkie pwn sinkie at a coffee shop drinking bhai tea, eating nasi lemak while listening to Man Yao?"
112,"Lived/studied/worked overseas in the UK and US for coming up to a decade now. No regrets, and I can’t really imagine myself permanently moving back to Singapore."
113,you better be white if you are thinking of migrating to those countries.
114,">Australia  
>Canada  
>better climate

Hahhahahahahah"
115,"After you look at all the statistics and debunk all of the pappist narrative drilled into us since young, the grass is really greener on the other side leh..

The remainder is just subjective factors which obviously varies for each individual."
116,">generally lower expenses   
- Uh you can't get $3.20 cai png in any of those countries. Public transport there ain't cheap too."
117,"If you stay you can do something about the housing price. Like the west, we financialized our home, allowing the rich, financial institutions, foreigners to speculate, invest, extract rent from afar. LKY bought back most of the land, so Singapore government owned 90% of the land now (49% in 1965). China is only the other country that successfully executed land reform. Vote for the party that will say Singapore land belongs to Singaporean, and one should not be loaded with a life time of lease repayment to the HDB. Why not free strata title for people who opt to live in HDB? If HDB extract less from people, reduce the 5 years wait time, young people like you will not consider migration and has more discretionary spend, hence may choose even to have more kids."
118,"Australia is so nice... I like the weather, the people, food, outdoors.."
119,"What about the Middle East? Somewhere like UAE or Qatar? Great salaries, summer months from April to August can be slightly harsh but the winters are pleasant. The governments are very expat friendly, good healthcare, infrastructure (quite similar to SG in cities like Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha), and 0 income taxes. Middle Eastern countries are very well connected for travelling to pretty much anywhere in the world.

I spent 13 years in Qatar before moving to Singapore."
120,No. I'm not a traitor
